# stocks_tracker

A new Flutter project.

I have added a seaparate page for the first button stocks right now 
not for the other two buttons so when pressed they don't do anything as of yet.



Work on StocksScreen.dart to add a searchbar and appbar 

Also if you know how to make buttons look better let me know
I have used the classe/widget raisedbutton for the 3 buttons
if you can achieve better results using some other class/widget tell me.



And if you want to not use a widget array for arranging stuff because its too 
complicated and have a better way to do it tell me asap.
